### **Adventure Mode Introduction (PvE)**

Adventure mode, also known as Player versus Environment (PvE).

In adventure mode, you are playing against AI from CollarQuest Controllers. There are 36 levels in total, and with each level, the difficultly gets increasingly harder. Playing in PvE gives your Genesis Mechanism (GeM) which they use to level up. Leveling up your SPARC-E, in turn, increases their health and attack. **So, the higher level your SPARC-E are, the easier it gets to beat the levels.**

By playing PvE, you can earn up to a total of 100 GeM (Genesis Mechanism) per day. The amount of GeM you win depends on the PvE level that you play.

| **SPARC-E Level** | **GeM Reward**    |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Level 1 – 4       | 1 GeM per win     |
| Level 5 – 9       | 2 GeM per win     |
| Level 10 – 14     | 4 GeM per win     |
| Level 15 – 16     | 6 GeM per win     |
| Level 17 – 20     | 5-10 GeM per win  |
| Level 21 – 36     | 10-20 GeM per win |

Based on the chart above, playing Levels 21-36 would be the fastest way to gain your 100 daily GeM. However, you’ll need to level up your SPARC-Es and play the lower levels before you can beat the higher ones.

The level of your SPARC-E only apply to PvE and has no bearing in the Arena.
