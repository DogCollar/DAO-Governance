### Arena mode, also known as Player vs Player (PvP).

Much like Pokemon has gone through numerous iterations and types of battle systems, we also expect CollarQuest to have many variations of battles over the years to come.

In arena, you are playing against other players in the CollarQuest ecosystem. You will be matched with players of the same skill level through your Match Making Rating (MMR).

For every win, your MMR increases, and for every loss, it decreases. The amount of GeM you can gain in Arena depends on your MMR. Using the table below, for example, if you have an MMR of 950, you can earn 3-4 GeM for every win you get. Losing does not earn you any GeM.

| **Arena Bracket** | **GeM Reward** |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| 800 – 950         | 1 GeM          |
| 950 – 1150        | 3-4 GeM        |
| 1150 – 1350       | 6 GeM          |
| 1350 – 1450       | 9 GeM          |
| 1450 – 1550       | 12 GeM         |
| 1550 – 1650       | 15 GeM         |
| 1650 – 1750       | 18 GeM         |
| 1750+             | 20 GeM         |

### SPARC-Es Energy Explainer

There is a limit to how much GeM you can earn and how much XP you can gain in a day, and the limit to these are constrained by your in-game energy.  Partial energy is gained every six hours.

The amount of energy you get a day depends on how many SPARC-Es you have. If you have 3-9 SPARC-Es, you get 20; if you have 10-19, you get 40; and if you have more than 20, you get 60.

Each time you play PvE or PvP, you spend 1 energy.  However, even if you do not have energy, you can still play; you just won’t gain GeM (in Arena) or XP (in Adventure).

For example, if you are playing in Adventure mode, when you have energy, you can gain both GeM and XP. If you do not have energy, you can gain GeM (up to the daily limit of 50), but you cannot gain XP anymore.

**This means that even without energy, you can still play until you reach the 50 GeM daily limit**, but your SPARC-Es won’t level up.

On the other hand, if you are playing in Arena, when you have energy, you can gain both GeM and MMR points. If you do not have energy, you can gain MMR points, but you cannot gain GeM anymore. This means that even without energy, you can still try to improve your MMR so that the next time you play, you can get higher GeM for your wins.

### Intro to CollarQuest Gameplay

The main objective of the game, both PvE and PvP, is to wreck all your opponent’s SPARC-Es/Villains before they wreck all of yours. To do this, you have to carefully choose your abilities and watch out for your ability energy count.

### Adventure Mode Main Screen

The different components of the Adventure screen are numbered in the picture above. Here’s what each number represents:

1. **Every level is called a drained.** If you have completed a level, you will see 1-3 stars below it. The stars indicate how many of your SPARC-Es have survived when you completed that level.
2. **How many villains** you will have to defeat within the level.
3. This shows **what kind of villains** you will encounter within the level. Clicking on any villain shows you the class and description of the villain.
4. **Daily GeM limit counter** — showing that 0/50 of the max GeM have been claimed today.
5. **Energy counter** is in the top left.
6. **SPARC-E Inventory.** Clicking this would show you your SPARC-Es and their abilities, as well as let you change their lineup placement. You can also change your team here.
7. **The level of each SPARC-E.**
8. Once you are ready to fight, **the Start button begins the game.**

#### Arena Mode on CollarQuest

Unlike Adventure mode, Arena mode doesn’t have a main screen. Once you click on “Arena“, you will be immediately matched to an opponent.

For both Arena and Adventure mode, the mechanics and components are pretty similar. The important parts of the Arena are numbered in the image above. Here’s what each number represents:

1. **Battle energy** is shown in the bottom left — not to be confused with your daily game energy. In Arena, each player starts with three energy.  Each subsequent round adds another two energy. So, for example, if you spend two energy in round one, you’ll get one remaining energy plus two new energy for round two (so, three energy).
2. **Number of cards remaining** in your deck is in the bottom left. The important thing to remember here is that your SPARE-Es each have four abilities, and you have 24 cards in a deck. This means that for each deck, you will see each ability for each of your only SPARC-E twice, before moving on to a new deck.
3. **SPARC-E who possesses the abilities (cards)** above.
4. **Abilities for the particular SPARC-E** seen below.
5. **Energy needed** to use the ability.
6. **Attack.** This is the damage your SPARC-E can deal with this ability.
7. **Shield.** This is the shield your SPARC-E can get from this ability. The opponent’s attack will take away shield until the shield is depleted, then start taking health.
8. More detailed explanation on the **description of some abilities.**
9. Push this button to **end your turn** once you’ve made all your moves.
10. **Number of rounds so far in this game.** It is important to note that at Round 10, the Final-SOLUTION will start, which means that at the end of that round and onwards, all SPARC-Es will receive a 50 HP deduction.
11. **The order the SPARC-Es will attack.** The faster the speed of the SPARC-E, the earlier they will always attack.
12. **Number of cards left in your opponent’s deck at the start of the last turn.** Used for counting opponents cards.
13. **Settings.** If you’d like to surrender the game.&#x20;
