# Battling

The CollarQuest battle system is being structured as an "idle battle" system with inspiration from games like "Final Fantasy Tactics" and "Idle Heroes".

The CollarQuest dev team started development on the real-time card battle system and application in October 2021.

Much like Pokemon has gone through numerous iterations and types of battle systems, we also expect CollarQuest to have many variations of battles over the years to come.
