# SATCHEL

The Sparc-e Automated Transportation & Conveyance Humanoid ELement (SATCHEL) will be your robot's remote presence in CollarQuest Ariomont (Land) gameplay.  If you have a wallet with a SPARC-E, you will have a SATCHEL; the DAO may vote to charge for SATCHEL mods.

SATCHEL pros/cons of this humanoid robot could be that a SATCHEL travels fastest with no SPARC-Es deployed and slowest with all 3 SPARC-Es deployed; SPARC-Es can find hidden items when deployed; SPARC-Es do not need to be deployed all or none, thus providing 4 levels of options and cost/benefit of using different gameplay strategy for travel.  We will have other modes of travel to allow SATCHELs to get around the large land play for quests.
