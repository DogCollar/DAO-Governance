# Breeding & Royalties

![CollarQuest a Metaverse Play2Earn Ecosystem](../../../.gitbook/assets/CollarQuest-SM.png)

Like real-world pets, SPARC-E can be bred to create new offspring. To avoid hyperinflation of SPARC-E there is a maximum amount of times a SPARC-E can be bred before it is sterile.

Breeding a SPARC-E costs Dog Tag (TAG) and some Genesis Mechanism (GeM) depending on how many times the SPARC-E has been bred. The TAG portion is variable and subject to adjustment based on a myriad of economic factors.

* CollarQuest DAO will not sell $GeM to players directly
* CollarQuest DAO will not provide liquidity for $GeM

| **Breed Count** | **Breed Number** | **Total GeM Cost** |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **(0/7)**       | **1**            | **600**            |
| **(1/7)**       | **2**            | **900**            |
| **(2/7)**       | **3**            | **1500**           |
| **(3/7)**       | **4**            | **2400**           |
| **(4/7)**       | **5**            | **3900**           |
| **(5/7)**       | **6**            | **6300**           |
| **(6/7)**       | **7**            | **10200**          |

**Genesis Mechanism **_**can be earned by playing the game in PvE Adventure mode as well as the PvP Arena.**_

### **Genetics**

Each SPARC-E has 6 body parts as well as a body shape. For each part, a SPARC-E possesses 3 components. A dominant (D), recessive (R1), and minor recessive component (R2).

The dominant components are what determines the body part that is physically present on the SPARC-E. When breeding, each component has a chance to be passed down to offspring:

**Dominant (D):** 37.5% chance to pass this component to offspring.

**Recessive (R1):** 9.375% chance to pass this component to offspring.

**Minor Recessive (R2):** 3.125% chance to pass this component to offspring.

In order to breed, simply go to the page for one of your SPARC-E by clicking on it through your inventory.

Then select a SPARC-E to pair it with!

**How Long Does it take for a SPARC-E to become an adult?**

SPARC-E takes 5 days to reach maturity.

After 5 days, you can morph your offspring box into an adult SPARC-E and see the SPARC-E's components.

## Breeder Royalties (SPARC-E Offspring)

When members breed their SPARC-Es and then sell the offspring, the member retains a 5% royalty in perpetuity for each and every time that offspring SPARC-E is sold on an open market - after the initial sale. Example: a SPARC-E owner breeds 2 SPARC-Es, and sells the offspring to buyer number 1. The original breeder does NOT receive 5% on this sale. Buyer number 1 sells that offspring SPARC-E to buyer number 2. The original owner/breeder DOES receive 5% on the secondary and all future sales.
