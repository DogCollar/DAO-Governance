# Staking and Staking Rewards

![CollarQuest a Metaverse Play2Earn Ecosystem](../../.gitbook/assets/CQ-Title.png)

### **Staking**

Staking is a way for us to reward our community members for having a long-term mindset and locking up their TAG tokens. By staking your TAG youâ€™ll be able to earn TAG rewards when you lock up your tokens through the staking dashboard. In the future, staking TAG will give you voting rights.

Dog Collar (COLLAR), Dog Tag (TAG) Tokens will have staking rewards on CollarSwap (ETH) and QuickSwap (POLY).&#x20;

#### Dog Tag (TAG) Reward and Governance Token to COLLAR&#x20;

Dog Tag (TAG) is key to our long-term future of TAG DAO LLC. TAG offers a method of ongoing funding to our TAG DAO LLC organization by providing the funding needed to operate our growing operations, direction will be provided via our DAO voting. Figure A1 visualizes the ONE TIME distributions of the governance token called TAG. TAG will become the TAG DAO LLC oversight governance token via our DAO. TAG will not go into effect as the governance token of TAG DAO LLC until sixty (60) days post Liquidly Event (LE) event. See [Dog Tag Tokenomics](../../tokenomics/tokenomics/dog-tag/) for minting allocation, treasury, reserves, and incentives to achieve our lofty goals in bringing TAG DAO LLC to the forefront as the Gold Standard in self-governance.

The TAG fundamentals design goals are to provide a market competitive incentive for STAKING and FARMING of COLLAR and TAG to receive fees and the reward token Dog Tag (TAG). Dog Tag (TAG) has been minted and can be seen here. The 200 Million TAG Tokens will start as a reward (Play to Earn and STAKING/FARMING) token at the time COLLAR and TAG LP are deployed on the GOJ platform.
