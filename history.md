Like many others, COLLAR is an ERC-20 token that began its life as someone’s experiment or training exercise. COLLAR, simplistic in its code and born out of an apparent coding tutorial, is as fundamental a token as one can expect. After creation, COLLAR was left cast aside and overshadowed for weeks by other projects. As the second token to be launched on ShibaSwap, \(with half the supply burned to the Shib token contract\), community members decided to revitalize this underdog and prove gimmicks, fancy code, and “to the moon” marketing pushes are not necessary.
