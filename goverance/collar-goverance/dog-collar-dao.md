# COLLAR DAO

![](../../.gitbook/assets/1080x360.jpg)

What Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\)?

One of the major features of digital currencies is that they are decentralized. This means they are not controlled by a single institution like a government or central bank, but instead are divided among a variety of computers, networks, and nodes. In many cases, virtual currencies make use of this decentralized status to attain levels of privacy and security that are typically unavailable to standard currencies and their transactions.

## **Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\)**

DeFi inspired the foundation of the COLLAR DAO not to have a single person or institution that has more control. Our focus and attention to detail empower the \#collarcrew to have meaningful oversight of the COLLAR governance.  


We invite and encourage the current and future \#collarcrew to join the COLLAR DAO at: [https://snapshot.org/\#/dogcollar.eth](https://governance.collartoken.com/#/) and connect with other members via our official Discord server [https://discord.gg/collarcrew](https://discord.gg/collarcrew).
