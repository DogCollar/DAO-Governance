## Individual Multi-signature Member’s Authority and Responsibilities

An individual Multi-signature member exercises the authority and responsibility of their position only when the Multi-signature members are directed by the CollarQuest DAO.

No member of the Multi-signature has the authority to act in the name of the CollarQuest DAO unless so authorized by the affirmative vote of the majority of members of the CollarQuest DAO. When authorized to act as the CollarQuest’s designated representative in official actions, a Multi-signature or CEO member may make and accept proposals in approved subject to subsequent approval by the CollarQuest DAO.
