## Individual Board Member’s Authority and Responsibilities

An individual Board member exercises the authority and responsibility of their position only when the Board is in session with a quorum of the Board present.

No member of the Board has the authority to act in the name of the Board unless so authorized by the affirmative vote of the majority of members of the Board. When authorized to act as the COLLAR’s designated representative in official actions, a Board member may make and accept proposals in approved subject to subsequent approval by the Board.

A Board member has the right to express personal opinions. When expressing such opinions in public, the Board member must clearly identify the opinions as their own.
