## Individual Multi-signature Member’s Authority and Responsibilities

An individual Multi-signature member exercises the authority and responsibility of their position only when the Multi-signature members are directed by the COLLAR DAO.

No member of the Multi-signature has the authority to act in the name of the COLLAR DAO unless so authorized by the affirmative vote of the majority of members of the COLLAR DAO. When authorized to act as the COLLAR’s designated representative in official actions, a Multi-signature or CEO member may make and accept proposals in approved subject to subsequent approval by the COLLAR DAO.

A Multi-signature member has the right to express personal opinions. When expressing such opinions in public, the Multi-signature member must clearly identify the opinions as their own.
