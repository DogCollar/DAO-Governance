# How Voting Works

![The power of the \#CollarCrew is in the hands of us all.](../../.gitbook/assets/reddit_profile_banner_template_8.jpg)

Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\), Dog Collar \(COLLAR\) HODL with greater than 100,000,000,000 \(100 Billion\) Tokens can participate in all DAO Proposal votes.

In other words, a supermajority voting provision requires greater than a majority of COLLAR HODL approval for certain actions to be approved.  Example: Voting rights, COLLAR DAO (minimum HODL, anti-whale, token burn requests)</code></em>

* Member Voting: Any COLLAR HODL with greater than 100,000,000,000 \(100 Billion\) in ONE wallet will be able to cast votes.  

  * An anti-whale voting feature has been added to the DAO and will be adjusted and reported over time.
  * A \#collarcrew member wallet will lose voting rights if it is found that the member acts in bad faith.

* New Proposal: 
  * A COLLAR HODL with greater than 5,000,000,000,000 \(5 Trillion\) in ONE wallet that HODL can submit a new proposal for consideration.
  * Multi-signature donation wallet signers may submit a new proposal without the 5,000,000,000,000 \(5 Trillion\) requirement. This additional privilege is not designed for self-benefit but allows for straw proposals to help narrow down options when clarity is needed from the community on an action item.
