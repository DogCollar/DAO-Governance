| September 20, 2021 - Proposed language for consideration. |
| :--- |


`Vacancies will be filled by appointment by the Board. The Board appointee must be a current COLLAR HODL who will serve until the next regular election, at which time a replacement will be duly elected.`

`Board elections are held every year which for the purposes of this policy are termed “election” years. The appointee:`

1. `Will serve until December 31 following the next “election,” at which time the individual elected in that year will fill the remaining portion of an unexpired term or serve a full two-year term; or`
2. `Will serve until December 31 of a subsequent “election” year if the vacancy occurs after the filing date in an “election” year.`

`A Board member so elected will serve the remaining years of the term of office of the Board member being replaced`

`Upon appointment by the Board, the newly appointed Board member(s) may be sworn and seated immediately or at a date set by the current Board.`

`In the event of multiple vacancies, the position of the Board member who resigned first will be filled first.`
