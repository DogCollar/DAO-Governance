# Multi-signature Vacancies

![](../../.gitbook/assets/1080x360.jpg)

Vacancies will be filled by COLLAR DAO vote. The Multi-signature candidate must be a current COLLAR HODL who will serve until the next regular COLLAR DAO vote, at which time a replacement will be selected.

Multi-signature elections are held every year which for the purposes of this policy are termed “Multi-signature Representative” years. The Multi-signature:

1\) Will serve until December 31 following the next “election,” at which time the individual selected to sign as a Multi-signature in that year will fill the remaining portion of an unexpired term or serve a full two-year term; or

2\) Will serve until December 31 of a subsequent year if the vacancy occurs after the filing date in an COLLAR DAO voting year.

A Multi-signature member so selected by the COLLAR DAO will serve the remaining years of the term of office of the Multi-signature member being replaced

Upon selected by the COLLAR DAO, the newly selected Multi-signature member(s) may be seated immediately or at a date set by the current Board.

In the event of multiple vacancies, the position of the Multi-signature member who resigned first will be filled first.
