## **Get Started With Governance**

CollarQuest ecosystem includes but is not limited to [Dog Collar (COLLAR)](../../tokenomics/tokenomics/dog-collar-collar.md), [Dog Tag (TAG)](../../tokenomics/tokenomics/dog-tag/), Genesis [Mechanism (GeM)](../../tokenomics/tokenomics/genesis-mechanism-gem/), [SPARC-Es](../../tokenomics/tokenomics/collarquest-sparc-e.md), [Land (Airomont)](../../tokenomics/tokenomics/collarquest-land.md), and the [CollarQuest Tokenomics](broken-reference) to return the benefits back to the CollarQuest ecosystem.  CollarQuest is under the direction of TAG DAO LLC.

CollarQuest Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a decentralized governance community that enables the CollarQuest Community to self-govern.  CollarQuest Community has the sole authority to enact changes.

CollarQuest DAO governance describes the way rules, norms, and actions are structured, sustained, regulated, and upheld.

**Our founding beliefs include:**

* Connecting people who believe that decisions are made through a fair and open dialog process. Where we hold CollarQuest DAO Proposals votes and support the outcome of the community DAO voting process, even if it is not the outcome the person would have wanted it to be.\
  ****
* We, the CollarQuest DAO of Self-Governance, challenge ourselves to promote, advance, and advocate the vision of Self-Governance with dignity, integrity, and respect for the CollarQuest members we serve.
