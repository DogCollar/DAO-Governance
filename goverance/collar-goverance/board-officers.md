## Multi-signature Officers

At its first scheduled meeting in January, the COLLAR DAO will elect one member to serve in the ceremonial title of CEO. No member of the Multi-signature may serve as CEO for more than two years in succession. If the CEO member is unable to continue to serve, a replacement will be elected immediately from a COLLAR DOA vote. The replacement CEO will serve the remainder of the term until the following January. The replacement term for the CEO does not count against the two consecutive years of service.

## CEO

The CEO will:

1. Bring froward for a COLLAR DAO vote committee proposals;\

2. Sign official documents that require the signature of the CEO;\

3. Represent the COLLAR Community at official functions, unless this duty is delegated by the COLLAR DAO to another member of the community;\

4. Propose all committees and make all liaison appointments for a COLLAR DAO vote;\

5. Have the right to discuss issues and vote.
