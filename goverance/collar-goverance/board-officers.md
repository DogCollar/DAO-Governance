| :--- |


## Board Officers

`At its first scheduled meeting in January, the Board will elect one of its members to serve as chair and one to serve as vice chair. No member of the Board may serve as chair more than two years in succession. If the Board member is unable to continue to serve as an officer, a replacement will be elected immediately. The replacement officer will serve the remainder of the officerâ€™s term until the following July. The replacement term for chair does not count against the two consecutive years of service for that office.`

## `Board Chair`

`The Board chair will:`

`1. In consultation with the vice chair, establish the meeting agendas;`

`2. Call special meetings when required;`

`3. Preside at all meetings of the Board and enforce the rules of order;`

`4. Sign official documents that require the signature of the chair;`

`5. Represent the COLLAR Community and the Board at official functions, unless this duty is delegated by the chair or the Board to another member of the Board;`

`6. Appoint all committees and make all liaison appointments unless otherwise ordered by the Board;`

`7. Have the right to discuss issues and vote.`

## `Board Vice Chair`

`In the absence, incapacitation, or death of the chair, the vice chair will perform the duties of chair and, when so acting, will have the powers of the chair. The vice chair will perform such other functions as designated by the Board. If both are absent, the person with the longest period of service on the Board will conduct the meeting.`

`The vice chair will participate with the chair in agenda planning.`
