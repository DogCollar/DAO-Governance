## Dog Collar (COLLAR) Organizational Chart

The COLLAR Organizational Chart is our way of showing that the current elected individuals; COLLAR as a community have voted to assist in the growth of the #collarcrew future.

This document is to help new #collarcrew members to understand the positions acquired but to always keep in mind we are all Collar Crew. All individuals elected joined the #collarcrew and helped COLLAR evolve into what we are today. You too may grow into what you desire as we are all part of this community together.

On September 3, 2021, the following people were installed as our founding multi-signature wallet signers are; Position #1 Morpheus (Chair), #2 Jared Dunn (Vice-Chair), position #3 Mr. Johnny Five, position #4 Nemo, position #5 LShtivi. The multi-signature wallet signers are NOT granted additional authority over the Dog Collar (COLLAR) project.

Position terms. These positions are for two (2) year terms. With the best practice of not having 100% oversight turnover, we have created a staggered process to provide the best protection to our community. Position #1 and #3 will be up for election by December 31, 2022, position #2, #4 and #5 will be up for election by December 31, 2023.

In the #collarcrew community, each Committee Chair will work with other members to build the working committee. The committee Chair's role is to help facilitate the committee's process and provide assistance where needed.

Committee Chairs may bring forward a committee recommendation to the COLLAR leadership for review and to confirm the proposal follows our founding vision before that recommendation moving forward for public debate

At the first regular meeting after January 1 and also before January 31 in an election year, the Board will meet to organize for the year.

The organizational meeting will consist of, but not be limited to, the following:

1. Election of officers;
