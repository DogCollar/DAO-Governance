With the adoption of COLLAR Community Paper (CP) 1.0, the work of identifying what the communities’ interests are and creating verbiage to be debated on Discord, then to bring the well-thought motions to the floor for a vote by the CollarQuest HODL begins. The following items are only the start for the CollarCrew future work to evolve the living document called Community Paper.‌

* Increasing Dog Collar (COLLAR) HODL
* Identifying charities
* [Utility](../../collarquest/collarquest/)
* Grow community
* [Tokenomics](broken-reference)
* Identifying partnerships
* Multiple exchange listings
* Continual self-improvement
