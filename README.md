# Dog Collar \(COLLAR\) DAO Governance

Community Governance Documents

The Dog Collar \(COLLAR\) DAO has been created as a DAO governance gold standard for the COLLAR community. We strive not only to lead by example but also to give back to all by making our DAO governance documents available for others to use.

Our core beliefs are:

1\) Connecting people who believe that decisions are made through a fair and open dialog process. Where we hold COLLAR DAO Proposals votes and support the outcome of the community DAO voting process, even if it is not the outcome the person would have wanted it to be.

2\) We, the COLLAR DAO of Self-Governance, challenge ourselves to promote, advance, and advocate the vision of Self-Governance with dignity, integrity, and respect for the \#collarcrew we serve.
