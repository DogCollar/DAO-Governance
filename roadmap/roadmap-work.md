![](../.gitbook/assets/1080x360.jpg)

With the adoption of our COLLAR CP 1.0, now the work of identifying what the communities’ interests are and creating verbiage to be debated on Discord, then to bring the well-thought motions to the floor for a vote by the COLLAR HODL begins. The following items are only the start for the \#collarcrew future work to evolve the living document called Dog Collar CP.‌

* Increasing COLLAR HODL
* Identifying charities
* Identifying utility
* Grow community
* Identifying Tokenomics
* Identifying partnerships
* Multiple exchange listings
* Continual self-improvement
