## Legal Considerations, Risks, and Disclaimer

This is a living document, and information is up to date at the time of publishing.  Please note information herein does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice, and you should not treat any of the content as such.

The Dog Collar \(COLLAR\) team suggests you conduct your due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. By purchasing any COLLAR product, you agree that you are not purchasing a security or investment, and you agree to hold the team harmless and not liable for any losses or taxes you may incur. You also agree that the team is presenting the product\(s\) “as is” and is not required to provide any support or services. You should have no expectation of any form from the COLLAR and its team. Although COLLAR is a community-driven DeFi and not a registered digital currency, the team strongly recommends that citizens in areas with government bans on Crypto do not purchase it because the item cannot ensure compliance with your territories regulations. Always make sure that you are in compliance with your local laws and regulations before you make any purchase.
