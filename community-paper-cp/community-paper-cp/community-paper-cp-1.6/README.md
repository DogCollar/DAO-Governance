SUMMARY

Request for consideration to amend TAG DAO LLC Community Paper 1.5.2 to reflect:

Section 1) Future DAO proposal guidelines\
Section 2) DAO managed SPARC-E teams\
Section 3) DAO Treasury and Member minted SPARC-Es\
Section 4) TAG Reward for Native Token Liquidity Pairs

SECTION 1: FUTURE DAO PROPOSAL GUIDELINES

1a) No self-serving DOA proposals (i.e., no DAO proposals to redirect DAO wallet(s) to any nonaffiliated TAG DAO LLC project-controlled wallet)

1b) DOA proposals that seek to direct project funds or extensive resources shall only be considered valid DOA proposals when accompanied by a budget impact statement.

1c) DOA proposals may be removed if a proposal directs said project to violate domestic or international law (i.e., copyright violation, self-serving DAO outcomes, in direct conflict with the policies or administrative rules governed by TAG DAO LLC WY USA LLC Sub Type DAO)

1d) No DAO proposals shall be valid for auto settling wallet transfers by automatic outcomes from DAO proposals votes. All DAO proposals to the affirmative shall be reviewed manually to ensure the DAO guidelines are followed.

SECTION 2: DOA MANAGED SPARC-E TEAMS

TAG DAO LLC has received more than 5,000 Cadets applications. The goal of TAG DAO LLC is to advance the project towards mass adoption. With that goal, It is recommended that the DAO utilize the unused inventory of SPARC-Es for the DAO's benefit. Therefore, the Ceremonial CEO or their delegate(s) may choose to use these unsold SPARC-Es, by way of loaning out to uncommitted CollarQuest Academy Cadets.

DAO-owned SPARC-Es/cadet team payments will be paid out to cadets at a rate of 10% less than the average of privately owned Manager/SPARC-Es/cadet agreements in place at the beginning of each month.

Example Scenario A: Existing Manager-Cadet relationships have an average split of Manager 60%, Cadet 40%.

Scenario A Result: A Cadet interested in playing the game would be able to borrow SPARC-Es directly from the DAO at a 35% split because 40% is the average split being given to the Cadet by Private Managers as of that time.

Important: The DAO is not interested in competing with SPARC-E Managers offering a fair split. Hence, the division given to the Cadet that is interested in playing but has no means to do so will be 10% LESS than the average split offered by Managers at the time of the DAO-Cadet engagement. (Beginning the 1st day of each month).

Cadets are not allowed to sell/breed non-owned SPARC-Es.

SECTION 3: DAO TREASURY AND MEMBER MINTED SPARC-ES

For the financial sustainability of the DAO and to stay current with industry standards, royalties will be 10% total.

When members breed their SPARC-Es and then sell the offspring, the member retains a 5% royalty in perpetuity for each and every time that offspring SPARC-E is sold on an open market - after the initial sale. Example: a SPARC-E owner breeds 2 SPARC-Es, and sells the offspring to buyer number 1. The original breeder does NOT receive 5% on this sale. Buyer number 1 sells that offspring SPARC-E to buyer number 2. The original owner/breeder DOES receive 5% on the secondary and all future sales.
