# Robert’s Rules of Order

![](.gitbook/assets/reddit_profile_banner_template_8.jpg)

Robert’s Rules of Order \(RRoO\). The parliamentary procedure is a set of rules for conduct at meetings that allow everyone to be heard and make decisions without confusion. Parliamentary procedure is essential because it's a time-tested method of conducting business at meetings and public gatherings. In most cases, we do not need to utilize RRoO as we are a respectful \#collarcrew who seeks input from all. RRoO shines when we find that we have a challenging topic with many different points of view; in those situations, we will utilize the RRoO framework to find confesses and speak with one voice after the public vote, even if we would have hoped for a different outcome.
