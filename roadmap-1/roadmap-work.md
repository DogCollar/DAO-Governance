Once COLLAR CP 1.0 is adopted, then the work of identifying what the communities’ interests are and creating verbiage to be debated on Discord, then to bring the well-thought motions to the floor for a vote by the COLLAR HODL. The following items are only the start for the \#collarcrew future work to evolve the living document called Dog Collar CP.‌

* Increasing COLLAR HODL
* Identifying charities
* Identifying utility
* Grow community
* Identifying tokenomics
* Identifying partnerships
* Multiple exchange listings
* Continual self-improvement
