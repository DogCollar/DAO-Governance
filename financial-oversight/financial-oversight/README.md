## Financial Oversight

CollarQuest is proactively implementing effective financial control policies thorough analysis of the existing policies and future outlook for CollarQuest. In addition, it is important to ensure the following four processes are completed before implementing financial control for the CollarQuest DAO governance:

**1. Detecting overlaps and anomalies**

Financial budgets, financial reports, profit & loss statements, balance sheets, etc. present the overall performance and/or operational picture of a business. Hence, while formulating financial control policies, it is very important for us to detect any overlaps and/or anomalies arising out of the data available. It helps in detecting any existing loopholes in the current management framework and eliminating them.

**2. Timely updating**

Financial control is the essence of resource management and, hence, the overall operational efficiency and profitability of a business. Timely updates of all available data are very important. In addition, updating all management practices and policies concerning the existing financial control methods is also equally important.

**3. Analyzing all possible operational scenarios**

Before implementing a fixed financial control strategy in an organization, it is important to thoroughly evaluate all possible operational scenarios. Viewing the policies from the perspectives of different operational scenarios – such as profitability, expenditures, safety, and scale of production or volume – can provide the necessary information. Also, it helps establish an effective financial control policy that covers all operational aspects of the organization.

**4. Forecasting and making projections**

While implementing a financial control policy, forecasting and making projections are very important steps. They provide an insight into the future goals and objectives of the business. In addition, they can help establish a financial control policy in accordance with the business objectives and act as a catalyst in achieving such goals.

#### Importance of Financial Controls

**1. Cash flow maintenance**

Efficient financial control measures contribute significantly to the cash flow maintenance of an organization. When an effective control mechanism is in place, the overall cash inflows and outflows are monitored and planned, which results in inefficient operations.

**2. Resource management**

The financial resources of an organization are at the very core of any organization’s operational efficiency. Financial resources make available all other resources needed for operating a business. Hence, financial resource management is crucial in order to manage all other resources. Effective financial control measures hence are crucial to ensure resource management in an organization.

**3. Operational efficiency**

An effective financial control mechanism ensures overall operational efficiency in an organization.

**4. Profitability**

Ensuring an organization’s overall operational efficiency leads to the smooth functioning of every organizational department. It, in turn, increases productivity. which comes with a direct, positive relationship with profitability. Hence, establishing effective financial control measures ensures the improved profitability of CollarQuest DAO.

**5. Fraud prevention**

Financial control serves as a preventative measure against fraudulent activities in an organization. It can help prevent any undesirable activities such as employee fraud, online theft, and many others by monitoring the inflow and outflow of financial resources.
