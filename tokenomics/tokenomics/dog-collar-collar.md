        <p>Figure A2 visualizes the ONGOING distributions of the governance token
          called TAG. TAG is still going through a tokenomics design review. The
          TAG fundamentals design goals are to provide a market competitive incentive
          for STAKING and FARMING of COLLAR and TAG to receive fees and the reward
          token Dog Tag (TAG). As of the writing of the COLLAR CP 1.1, you will see
          we intentionally blacked out the percentage rewards from the tokenomics
          design review. Dog Tag (TAG) has been minted and can be seen <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x7797c85b46f548eacc07c229f6cd207d6370442f">here</a>.
          The 375 Million TAG Tokens will be released at the time COLLAR is deployed
          on the GOJ platform.</p>
