# Ecosystem Fund

The ecosystem fund will initially be managed by the Board of COLLAR or delegate staff, and its core purpose is to grow the CollarQuest community.&#x20;

To preserve the integrity of the fund the Board of COLLAR or delegate staff will prepare yearly statements that include a high-level overview of what the funds have been used for.  A framework for spending would be drafted and should be expected ready by March 30, 2022 The principles for the fund are as follows:

* Clear value added to the broader CollarQuest community
* Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and goals that unlock funds (if applicable)

As time passes the ecosystem fund will be integrated into the DAO and stakers will be able to vote on funding.
