# CollarQuest Tokenomics

## CollarQuest Tokenomics

Keep in mind that the HODL of our COLLAR project tokens are the ones that benefit from our work and growth.  When reading about our CollarQuest Tokenomics, think in the framework of when people want to play CollarQuest they need to buy 3 SPARC-E to play CollarQuest, when they buy the SPARC-Es the tokens they pay in will be routed to the following wallets. &#x20;

For example, the Treasury wallet is overseen by the board that represents the people who voted for them to be seated as Board members.  Once our tokenomics start our Board will hold Board meetings and when the Treasury wallet exceeds a Board directed % then the Board shall take action that could direct funds to new games to be added to our metaverse or add additional reward tokens into the gameplay for players to earn additional tokens.

All native tokens used for purchasing/upgrading/breeding SPARC-Es shall follow this same tokenomics.
