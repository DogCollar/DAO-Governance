## CollarQuest Tokenomics

When reading about the CollarQuest Tokenomics, think in the framework of when people want to play CollarQuest, they need to buy 3 SPARC-E to play CollarQuest. When players purchase SPARC-Es via the CollarQuest Marketplace, the payment will be routed using the CollarQuest Tokenomics shown in Figure I.

All native tokens used for purchasing/upgrading/breeding SPARC-Es, including CollarQuest land, building, or mini-games, shall follow this same CollarQuest Tokenomics.
