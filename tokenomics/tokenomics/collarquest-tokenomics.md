## CollarQuest Tokenomics

When reading about the CollarQuest Tokenomics, think in the framework of when people want to play CollarQuest, they need to buy 3 SPARC-E to play CollarQuest. When players purchase SPARC-Es via the CollarQuest Marketplace, the payment will be routed using the CollarQuest Tokenomics shown in Figure I.

The Treasury wallet is overseen by the Board representing the Collar Community.  See [`GOVERANCE`](../../goverance/collar-goverance/).  When the Collar Treasury wallet exceeds a Board directed %, the Board shall take action that could direct funds to new games to be devoloped for our CollarQuest metaverse or add additional reward tokens into the gameplay for players to earn.

All native tokens used for purchasing/upgrading/breeding SPARC-Es, including CollarQuest land, building, or mini-games, shall follow this same CollarQuest Tokenomics.

### NFT royalties

NFT royalties give a percentage of the sale price each time after the initial sale of the CollarQuest NFTs (SPARC-Es, Land, Buildings) are sold on any marketplace. NFT royalty payments are perpetual and are executed by smart contracts automatically. All CollarQuest gameplay NFTs (excluding power-ups, abilities) will have a 5% royalty where the fee is directed to CollarQuest Tokenomics see Figure I.

The NFT royalties are automatic payouts to the CollarQuest Tokenomics made on secondary sales. These are coded into the smart contract on the blockchain. Each time secondary sales happen, the smart contract ensures that the terms of the NFT are fulfilled. If a royalty is specified, a cut of the profits goes to the CollarQuest Tokenomics see Figure I.

There are no intermediaries needed, nor does this depend upon the wishes of whoever is transacting them. Please note that not all NFTs yield royalties. It has to be written explicitly into the terms. Once the smart contract terms are written into the blockchain, the rest is taken care of automatically.

The royalties paid to benefit the CollarQuest ecosystem by providing an ongoing fund to help the CollarQuest ecosystem.
