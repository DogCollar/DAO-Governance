# CollarQuest Tokenomics

## CollarQuest Tokenomics

When reading about our CollarQuest Tokenomics, think in the framework of when people want to play CollarQuest, they need to buy 3 SPARC-E to play CollarQuest. When players purchase SPARC-Es via the CollarQuest Marketplace, the payment will be routed using the tokenomics shown in Figure I.

For example, the Treasury wallet is overseen by the Board representing the people who voted for them to be seated as Board members. Once our tokenomics start, our Board will hold Board meetings. When the Treasury wallet exceeds a Board directed %, the Board shall take action that could require funds be directed to new games to be added to our metaverse or add additional reward tokens into the gameplay for players to earn.

All native tokens used for purchasing/upgrading/breeding SPARC-Es along including CollarQuest land, building or mini-games shall follow this same tokenomics.

### NFT Royalties

#### What are NFT royalties?

NFT royalties give a percentage of the sale price each time after the initial sale of CollarQuest NFTs (SPARC-Es, Land, Buildings) are sold on any marketplace. NFT royalty payments are perpetual and are executed by smart contracts automatically. All CollarQuest gameplay NFTs (excluding power-ups, abilities) will have a 5% royalty where the fee is directed to CollarQuest Tokenomics shown in Figure I.

The NFT royalties are automatic payouts to the CollarQuest Tokenomics made on secondary sales. These are coded into the smart contract on the blockchain. Each time a secondary sale happens, the smart contract ensures that the terms of the NFT are fulfilled. If a royalty is specified, a cut of the profits goes to the CollarQuest Tokenomics shown in Figure I.&#x20;

There are no intermediaries needed nor does this depend upon the wishes of whoever is transacting them. Please do note that, not all NFTs yield royalties. It has to be specifically written into the terms. Once the smart contract terms are clearly written into the blockchain, the rest is taken care off automatically.

The royalties paid benefit the CollarQuest ecosystem by providing an ongoing fund that will benefit the CollarQuest ecosystem.
