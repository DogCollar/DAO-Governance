# CollarQuest SPARC-E

![](../../.gitbook/assets/CollarQuest-SM.png)

Sentient Programmable Assault & Reconnaissance Canine - Entity (SPARC-E).  SPARC-Es will be created as NFTs with random characteristics, abilities, and various skills, which may battle against computer-controlled opponents or other real-life players.

The in-game SPARC-Es are NFTs, a unique digital asset exclusively owned by you! Any SPARC-E created or purchased through the game’s breeding mechanics will be an original digital asset that can be played, sold, or transferred in or out of the game!

To start playing CollarQuest you will need to create a CollarQuest account and buy a starter team of three (3) SPARC-Es.  You can buy as many SPARC-E as you wish to purchase, but you can only play a team of 3 SPARC-E at anyone time.  Those who are lucky to have more that 3 SPARC-e can choose to make any additional teams available for [CollarQuest Academy](../../collarquest/collarquest/collarquest-academy.md).

You can buy SPARC-E from the official CollarQuest Marketplace. Here, you will be able to use the search filters to find stats and traits of your desired SPARC-Es.

Players can also trade SPARC-E peer-to-peer, meaning you can purchase directly from other players, or your friends can give you SPARC-E for free (lucky you!).  More information about the CollarQuest Marketplace will be released as we get closer to releasing our CollarQuest Marketplace.

### Should you invest on more expensive SPARC-Es?

The cheapest SPARC-E, sometimes called “Bronze” SPARC-E, are cheap for a reason. They are usually the ones with a bad combination of stats and body parts that do not have good synergy.

In most cases, SPARC-E that are more expensive than the base price tend to have better body parts, stats and abilities.

Investing on a more expensive team will definitely get you ahead of others.

Having a more powerful team from the beginning means you will get to farm GeM faster in Adventure and Arena mode.

So, if you are able to save up a bit before purchasing your first team, we highly recommend avoiding Bronze SPARC-Es for your starter team.

Regardless, as long as you are able to find SPARC-Es that give you the best value, even budget starter teams should be enough to get you started.

Figure J shows the four (4) Step releases that we also call phases 1-4.  Phase 1 will release 12,000 SPARC-Es that will be price in three (3) different levels (4,000 Bronze, 4,000 Silver, and 4,000 Gold).  The odds of receiving special abilities or power ups increases from purchasing Silver over Bronze or Gold over Bronze and Silver level SPARC-Es.
