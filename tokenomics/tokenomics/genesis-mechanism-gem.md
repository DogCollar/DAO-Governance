## Genesis Mechanism (GeM) **CollarQuest Reward**

Like real-world pets, SPARC-Es can be bred to create new offspring. To avoid hyperinflation of SPARC-Es there is a maximum amount of times a SPARC-Es can be bred before it is sterile.

Breeding a SPARC-E costs Dog Tag (TAG) and some Genesis Mechanism (GeM) depending on how many times the SPARC-E has been bred. The TAG portion is variable and subject to adjustment based on a myriad of economic factors.

* CollarQuest does not sell $GeM players directly
* CollarQuest does not provide liquidity for $GeM
