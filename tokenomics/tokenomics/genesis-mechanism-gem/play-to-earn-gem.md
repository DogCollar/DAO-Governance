| Token Amount | % of total supply | Unlock Schedule               |
| 100,000,000  | 50%               | Gradual unlock over 48-months |

The play to earn issuance represents 50% of the total GeM supply. The goal of the play to earn tokens is to attract a wide range of players to the CollarQuest ecosystem in the hunt for token rewards and to give ownership and stake to the most active community members.&#x20;

We envision using the play to earn portion of the issuance to reward key behaviors within our ecosystem such as:

* Competing in the arena and winning matches.
* Winning tournaments.
* Interacting with and tending to your land plots.
* Using the CollarQuest marketplace.
* Breeding SPARC-E.
* Using future CollarQuest products that haven't been announced yet.

â€ŒThe Play to Earn allocation can be seen as a marketing budget for the CollarQuest ecosystem. When certain game modes and products are ready to be promoted, its play to earn allocation could be increased.

These allocations are something that could potentially be decided by governance over time.
