# Charity Outreach

![](../../.gitbook/assets/1080x360.jpg)

The \#collarcrew are a passionate group of individuals with the interest in helping others.

We are exploring partnerships that will provide a benefit the \#collarcrew from staking and or farming of COLLAR Tokens to earn fees and rewards. This will also provide the tokenomics that can bring in restricted funds into the multi-signature donation wallet

The COLLAR DAO will direct how the funds will be utilized, but a few possible charitable actions could be:

* Animals clinics for operations.
* Gifting restricted funds to an International Dog Rescue Agency
* Gifting of chickens, goats, cows, etc to at International Agency
* Other \#collarcrew recommendations
