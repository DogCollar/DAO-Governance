The CollarCrew are a passionate group of individuals with an interest in helping others.

We are exploring partnerships that will provide a benefit the CollarCrew from staking and or farming of COLLAR Tokens to earn fees and rewards. This will also provide the tokenomics that can bring in restricted funds into the multi-signature donation wallet

The TAG DAO LLC will direct how the funds will be utilized, but a few possible charitable actions could be:

* Animals clinics for operations.
* Gifting restricted funds to an International Dog Rescue Agency
* Gifting of chickens, goats, cows, etc to at International Agency
* Other CollarCrew recommendations
