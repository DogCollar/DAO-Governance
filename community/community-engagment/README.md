# Community Engagment

Dog Collar \(COLLAR\) is a stand-alone project and a fully community-organized token experience.

The fundamentals of COLLAR are, and always have been, the community itself. The community infuses purpose, utility, and direction to COLLAR. The community holds the intrinsic value, not the token. Tokens are simply an object to focus the power, talent, and tremendous ability of the community.

To that end, there will be no hidden roadmap, secret plans, or other opportunities for “insiders” to buy. All future developments, roadmaps, and opportunities will be planned in the open with input from all who wish to contribute. To our future -- together.
