# Project Funding

![](../../.gitbook/assets/reddit_profile_banner_template_8.jpg)

Our project will be funded by slowly selling some of our tokens from our multi-signature donation wallet through the upcoming months. This means that there wonâ€™t be dangerous price fluctuations that make the value of our token crash. The selling of tokens is necessary because a lot of the bigger exchanges demand deposits of either BTC, ETH, or fiat currency to get listed on their exchange. Other funds will be used for marketing campaigns to widen our reach. All of the transactions will be transparent and communicated to the \#collarcrew.
