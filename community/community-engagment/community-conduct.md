`1) No person utilizing COLLAR forms shall:`

> `1a) Haze, harass, intimidate, bully, cyberbully or menace another, or engage in behavior deemed by the community to endanger the safety or well being of directors, staff, self, or others;` 
>
> `1b) Initiate or circulate information one knows to be false concerning alleged tactics used by trolls that the community deems to divide members from the community's goodwill.`

> `2a) Point out the actions that violate the Community Conduct on COLLAR Forums and that the continued behaviors may lead to being muted or banned.`
>
> `2b) Mute the individual(s) for a period deemed appropriate.`
>
> `2c) Inform the individual(s) that we will utilize the COLLAR DAO to inform our community of a person that leadership requests support in banning from the venue. While we do not wish to take such actions; We will maintain a public record of the username(s). Samples of what was said and the suggested correction/remedies before being banned. As transparency is one of our modeled views for COLLAR, the individual(s) must submit a request for reconsideration. The request from such individual(s) shall incuded how they have changed and why the COLLAR DAO should reinstate access to the excluded individual(s) username(s).`

`The banned individual(s) username, along with the supporting documentation, shall remain publicly available till such time that the COLLAR community votes via the COLLAR DAO to reinstate or remove the entry from the public record.`
