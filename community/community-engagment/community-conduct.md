## Community Conduct on COLLAR Forums

The COLLAR community supports a welcoming forum for all to ask questions, offer opinions and learn from each other. The following guidelines are to assist the COLLAR community in interacting with each other.

1\) No person utilizing COLLAR official forums shall:

1. Haze, harass, intimidate, bully, cyberbully or menace another, or engage in behavior deemed by the community to endanger the safety or well being of directors, staff, self, or others; 
2. Initiate or circulate information one knows to be false concerning alleged tactics used by trolls that the community deems to divide members from the community's goodwill.



2\) When leadership becomes aware of such bad actors, they, at the sole discretion, may utilize any of the following:

1. Point out the actions that violate the Community Conduct on COLLAR Forums and that the continued behavior\(s\) may lead to being muted or banned. 
2. The first muting of the individual\(s\) shall be a minimum of 24 hours. This time allows the leadership to review the circumstances and determine the appropriate consequences.  
3. A second muting will occur if an individual\(s\) continues or repeats the same or similar behavior. The second muting will stay in effect pending the outcome of a review or COLLAR DAO vote to accept or reject the leadership recommendation to ban the individual\(s\). If leadership were to ban the individual\(s\), a log entry would be generated to inform the COLLAR community of the ban with the reasoning behind the action if leadership feels a public COLLAR DAO would serve the community, a COLLAR DAO vote with the reason of the username being prohibited from the COLLAR Community. 
4. We may maintain a public posting of the username\(s\), screenshots. and a summary of the incident. The individual\(s\) may seek an appeal of the determination. Transparency and access are some of our core values. If the individual\(s\) seeks to be reinstated after 30 days, we may reconsider removing the ban provided the individual\(s\) submit the request from such individual\(s\) shall include how they have changed and why the COLLAR DAO should reinstate access to the excluded individual\(s\) username\(s\).

The banned individual\(s\) username, along with the supporting documentation, may remain publicly available till such time that the COLLAR community votes via the COLLAR DAO to reinstate or remove the entry from the public record.
