## Dog Collar \(COLLAR\) DAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\), Dog Collar \(COLLAR\) HODL with greater than 100,000,000,000 \(100 Billion\) COLLAR Tokens can participate in all DAO Proposal votes.  On September 29, 2021, a COLLAR DAO vote approved adopting CP 1.1, with the direction to transition the COLLAR DAO governance from Dog Collar \(COLLAR\) token to the governance token Dog Tag \(TAG\) 30 days after COLLAR is deployed on the GOJ platform.

An electoral threshold is defined as a COLLAR DAO Proposal garnering greater than 20% of the circulating supply of COLLAR at the time of a COLLAR DAO Proposal meeting the posting requirements.

The basic requirement for adoption of a motion by its members, with a quorum, is a Majority Vote. A majority is more than half of the votes cast by persons entitled to vote, after taking blank votes and abstentions into account. The majority does not mean 51%. Example: In a situation with 1000 votes, the majority = 501 votes \(not 51% which = 510 votes\).

A supermajority voting provision, an amendment to the COLLAR founding charter, is a provision that states that certain DAO Proposal actions require much more than a mere majority – typically 67%-90% – approval from the COLLAR HODL to pass. In other words, a supermajority voting provision requires greater than a majority of COLLAR HODL approval for certain actions to be approved. Example: Voting rights, COLLAR DAO \(minimum HODL, anti-whale, token burn requests\)

The following rules have been set up in the interest of providing meaningful community oversight. Future voting rule changes will be from the outcome of public votes under the following conditions.

COLLAR DAO was created with the founding vision to allow anyone wallet holder with greater than 5,000,000,000,000 COLLAR may submit a new DAO Proposal. We encourage \#collarcrew members to work inside the framework of bringing forward ideas to the appropriate committee for public discussion. Please see the COLLAR Organization chart for the standing committee to identify the correct committee that matches your interest.

* Member Voting: Any COLLAR HODL with greater than 100,000,000,000 \(100 Billion\) in ONE wallet will be able to cast votes.  

  * An anti-whale voting feature has been added to the DAO and will be adjusted and reported over time.
  * A \#collarcrew member wallet will lose voting rights if it is found that the member acts in bad faith.

* New Proposal: 
  * A COLLAR HODL with greater than 5,000,000,000,000 \(5 Trillion\) in ONE wallet that HODL can submit a new proposal for consideration.
  * Multi-signature donation wallet signers may submit a new proposal without the 5,000,000,000,000 \(5 Trillion\) requirement. This additional privilege is not designed for self-benefit but allows for straw proposals to help narrow down options when clarity is needed from the community on an action item.
