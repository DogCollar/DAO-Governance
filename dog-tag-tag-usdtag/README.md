# Dog Tag (TAG) - $TAG

Dog Tag (TAG) is an ERC-20 governance token for the CollarQuest metaverse. TAG holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes. Players will also be able to earn $TAG when they play various games within the CollarQuest metaverse and through user-generated content initiatives.

Our goal with TAG is to align the incentives between the players of the game and the developers in novel and exciting ways. The mechanisms described above have two main goals:&#x20;

* To reward players for interacting with CollarQuest while simultaneously incentivizing them to hold on to their tokens so they can claim additional rewards.
* To decentralize the ownership and governance of COLLAR, TAG, CollarQuest referred to as the COLLAR Ecosystem.

We want the COLLAR Ecosystem to become the first game truly owned and operated by the community that plays it.  This opens up limitless possibilities but must be approached carefully. In the past, projects have been abandoned and become stagnant using the term “decentralization” as a ruse. The leadership team is steadfast in putting self-governance in place as quickly as possible.

Once our exchange partner Goji Crypto onboards COLLAR and TAG, then the Community Treasury will begin to receive revenues generated from a portion of staking rewards. This treasury will be governed by TAG stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized.&#x20;

The Treasury receives inflows from:

* 4.25% of all CollarQuest NFT marketplace transactions.
* The TAG portion of the breeding fee.

More streams will be added in the future from cosmetic sales, tournament entree fees, licensing fees, and more as new opportunities present themselves.
