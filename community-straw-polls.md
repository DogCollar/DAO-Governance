# Community Straw Polls

Community straw polls are quick polls that may happen on Discord or Telegram from time to time.  While polls are not official Governance DAO Proposals votes, we utilize the polls to ask an esential question to assist the overall community to bring forward better questions to an official DAO vote.

Community straw polls will be posted from trusted individuals who carry the title of Admin or other such titles in our \#collarcrew online community.
