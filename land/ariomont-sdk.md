# Ariomont SDK

The Ariomont SDK will initially be a map editor where players can use CollarQuest art assets to create games and other experiences. Once a game has been created it is saved as a Non-Fungible Token and can be traded. These NFTs can be placed on land and players will be able to click on them to enter the game inside.

Through this process, we aim to gradually decentralize the game creation aspect of the CollarQuest metaverse. It will be impossible for one team to built out all the content needed for Ariomont, especially if we reach hundreds of millions of users. User generated content is a scaling strategy for new experiences.
