# Land

Ariomont,  the SPARC-E homeland,  is divided into tokenized plots of land which act as homes and bases of operation for their SPARC-E . Plots can be upgraded over time using a variety of resources and crafting ingredients that can be found when playing the game.&#x20;

In addition, land-owners might find TAG tokens on their land plots, or use the SPARC-E  that occupy the land plot to explore resource nodes on the map. When interacting with resources nodes SPARC-E  can find TAG and potentially other resources.&#x20;

**Resource Gathering and Crafting**

* Resources will spawn in nodes across Ariomont and be used to upgrade both land and SPARC-E.
* Landholders will have first rights to any resources that spawn on their land.

**Real-Time PvE Battles**

Self-breed evil SPARC-E called DARKA are terrorizing Ariomont. Players will be able to take on DARKA in real-time battles either alone or in groups. DARKA will drop an assortment of resources, items, and blueprints used to upgrade land and individual SPARC-E.

Additional details about land will be released in time.

**The World**

Ariomont consists of 90,601 plots of Land. These Land plots are represented as Non-Fungible Tokens and can be freely traded by players.

Land gameplay is still being actively developed and will be released in phases.

Phase one is the gameplay mentioned above, and phase two will focus on turning Ariomont into a virtual world with a focus on user-generated content. Players will be able to create games using the Ariomont SDK and place these games on land that they own.&#x20;
